TESTED ON WINDOWS 10 / SERVER 2016. 
Don't bother with trying to use this on Windows 8/8.1.

This requires pssuspend.exe from SysInternals' PsTools by Mark Russinovich
in order to perform suspend tasks.

Go get PsTools at Microsoft's TechNet website:
https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/pstools.aspx

Place pssuspend.exe in the same folder as this text file, or at
your system's System32 folder, which is better.

The console login screen is switched on when the Force Disable DWM script is executed
as you'll get a black screen of nothingness if you keep the GUI Logon screen active.

I'm not responsible if you end up damaging your Windows installation
if you use the batch scripts involved here. No guarantees or warranty
is applicable.

Always place a backup of your dwm.exe elsewhere as this may or may not work
or if something else goes horribly wrong.
